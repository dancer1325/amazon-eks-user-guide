# Monitor your cluster performance and view logs<a name="eks-observe"></a>

* MANY available monitoring or logging tools / 
  * Amazon EKS log data -- can be streamed to --
    * AWS services or
    * partner tools
      * [AWS-supported open-source solution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/solution-eks.html)

* to view
  * cluster health and details
    * select **Clusters** | Amazon EKS console
  * details about any existing Kubernetes resources / deployed | cluster
    * see [View Kubernetes resources in the AWS Management Console](view-kubernetes-resources.md)

* Monitoring
  * == ðŸ‘€ important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon EKS ðŸ‘€
  * recommendations
    * collect monitoring data -- from -- ALL parts of your AWS solution
      * -> easily debug a multi-point failure
    * ðŸ‘€questions to wonder ðŸ‘€
      + What are your goals? if your clusters scale dramatically -> do you need real\-time notifications ?
      + What resources need to be observed?
      + How frequently do you need to observe these resources? Does your company want to respond quickly to risks?
      + What tools do you intend to use?
        + if you already run AWS Fargate -> use the built\-in [log router](fargate-logging.md)
      + Who do you intend to perform the monitoring tasks?
      + if something goes wrong -> whom do you want notifications to be sent to ?

## Logging and monitoring on Amazon EKS<a name="logging-monitoring"></a>

* built-in tools -- for -- logging & monitoring
  * ðŸ‘€Amazon EKS Control plane logging ðŸ‘€
    * -- records -- ALL API calls | your clusters
    * -- capture -- 
      * audit information
        * == actions / -- performed by the -- users
      * role-based information
    * forward the captured information -- to -- CloudWatch Logs | your account
      * see [Send control plane logs to CloudWatch Logs](control-plane-logs.md)
  * see [Logging and monitoring on Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/amazon-eks-logging-monitoring.html)

* uses of the logs
  * make it easy to
    * secure your clusters
    * run your clusters

* if you want low-level, customizable logging -> enabled [Kubernetes logging](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/)

* _Example:_ Amazon EKS authenticator logs | Amazon CloudWatch

    ```
    level=info msg="mapping IAM role" groups="[]"
    role="arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-NodeManagerRole-XXXXXXXX"
    username="eks:node-manager"
    ```

  * `username`
    * == Amazon EKS internal service role / -- performs -- specific operations -- for --
      * managed node groups
      * Fargate

* Amazon EKS -- is integrated with -- AWS CloudTrail
  * AWS CloudTrail
    * := ðŸ‘€AWS service / captures ALL API calls for Amazon EKS -- as -- events ðŸ‘€
      * included calls captured
        * calls -- from the -- Amazon EKS console 
        * code calls -- to the -- Amazon EKS API operations
        * see [Log API calls as AWS CloudTrail events](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)

* Kubernetes API server
  * -- exposes -- SOME metrics / -- are useful for --
    * monitoring
    * analysis
  * see [Monitor your cluster metrics with Prometheus](prometheus.md)

* if you want to configure Fluent Bit -- for -- custom Amazon CloudWatch logs -> see [Setting up Fluent Bit | CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html#Container-Insights-FluentBit-setup)
